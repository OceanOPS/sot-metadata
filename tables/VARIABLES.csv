CODE,NAME,DESCRIPTION
AIRTEMP,"Air temperature (at specified distance from reference surface)",""
ATMPRESS,"Atmospheric pressure",""
CDOM,"Fluorescence (DOM)","Flurometric coloured dissolved Organic matter concentration."
CNDC,"Conductivity","Conductivity measured by CTD or MicroCAT"
DEPTH,"Depth","Depth is the vertical distance below the surface."
DLWRAD,"Long-wave radiation (downwelling)",""
DSWRAD,"Downwelling Shortwave Flux In Air",'"shortwave" means shortwave radiation. Downwelling radiation is radiation from above. It does not mean "net downward". When thought of as being incident on a surface, a radiative flux is sometimes called "irradiance". In addition, it is identical with the quantity measured by a cosine-collector light-meter and sometimes called "vector irradiance". In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, "flux" implies per unit area, called "flux density" in physics.'
HUM,"Humidity  (at specified distance from reference surface)",""
IRR,"Irradiance",""
NITRATE,"NO3- (nitrate)","Nitrate concentration in sea water."
pCO2,"pCO2","Partial pressure of CO2."
PLANKTON,"Plankton","Plankton"
RAIN,"Rain",""
SOUND,"Ambient noise/sound",""
SSS,"Sea surface salinity","Salinity of sea water in the surface layer (upper ~1 m if observed in MW)."
SST,"Sea surface temperature","Temperature of the sea water at surface. The 'bulk' temperature refers to the depth of typically 2 m, the 'skin' temperature refers to within the upper 1 mm."
SUB_PRESS,"Pressure","Pressure(depth) measured by CTD."
SUB_SAL,"Ocean salinity","3D field of salinity of the ocean"
SUB_T,"Ocean temperature","3D field of temperature of the ocean Requested in upper and deep ocean."
TURBIDITY,"Diffuse attenuation coefficient (DAC), turbidity","Indicator of water turbidity and vertical processes in the ocean, extracted from ocean colour observation."
WAVESD,"Dominant wave direction","One feature of the ocean wave spectrum. It is the direction of the most energetic wave in the spectrum."
WD,"Horizontal wind direction at specified distance from reference surface","Horizontal wind direction at specified distance from reference surface"
WS,"Horizontal wind speed at specified distance from reference surface","Horizontal wind speed at specified distance from reference surface"
